# C Wrapper for Lipgloss

![Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/raw/main/docs/lipgloss.png)

## Overview
This is a **C wrapper** around the [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) Go library, which provides beautiful ANSI styling for terminal applications. This wrapper enables **C applications** to leverage Lipgloss's powerful styling capabilities.

## Features
- **Text Styling**: Apply bold, italic, underline, and other styles.
- **Color Management**: Supports foreground, background, and ANSI color profiles.
- **Border Support**: Add stylish borders around text elements.
- **Alignment & Layout**: Position elements using horizontal/vertical alignment.
- **Memory Management**: Ensures proper allocation and cleanup for C integration.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Reonarudo/liblipgloss.git
cd liblipgloss
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Go is installed and fetch the required modules:
```sh
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Build the Shared Library
```sh
make
```
This compiles the Go files and generates `liblipgloss.dylib`, which can be linked from C applications.

### 4. Run Tests
```sh
make test
```
This compiles and executes test cases to verify the wrapper's functionality.

## Usage
### Linking with C Applications
To use the library in a C project, include `CLipgloss.h` and link against `liblipgloss.dylib`:
```c
#include "CLipgloss.h"

int main() {
    DefaultRenderer();
    uint64_t style = NewStyle();
    style = StyleBold(style, 1);
    char* rendered = StyleRender(style, "Hello, Lipgloss!");
    printf("%s\n", rendered);
    FreeString(rendered);
    FreeStyle(style);
    return 0;
}
```
